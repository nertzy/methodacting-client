This project was started at the League of Technical Voters Codeathon 2.0 to make a Rails plugin that adds client functionality to the web service provided by the Method Acting entity-based social network.

See http://code.google.com/p/methodacting/ for Method Acting and http://codeathon.pbwiki.com/Entity-based%20social%20network for the Codeathon wiki project description.
